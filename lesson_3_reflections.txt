When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    We should use a remote repository when we want to work from multiple devices,
    or collaborate with others; or just to share our work with others or keep a
    backup of our work on GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we may be working on some parts of our project on the local repository.
    And if suddenly Git syncs the local and the remote repository (where new changes
    have been made), it will be very difficult to continue our work. So, manual
    pulling is necessary and very important.
